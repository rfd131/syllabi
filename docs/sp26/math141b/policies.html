        <h3>Learning Target Quiz Session Policies</h3>

        <h4 id="Tuesday-Sessions">Tuesday Quiz Sessions (Recitations)</h4>
        <p>Learning Target Quizzes are held on <strong>Tuesdays</strong> throughout the semester beginning in Week 2. These sessions are <strong>required</strong> and are the primary way you demonstrate proficiency on Learning Targets.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Tuesday Quiz Session Policies:</strong>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem;">
                <li>You will submit a form available through Canvas indicating the LT quizzes you wish to attempt in the session (Due Sunday night before the Tuesday session).</li>
                <li>If you do not submit the quiz sign up form you should still attend your Tuesday recitation. A packet will be printed for you, but without signing up, you cannot be certain that it includes the LT Quizzes you wish to attempt that week.</li>
                <li>You must attend the Tuesday recitation you are enrolled in.</li>
                <li>To facilitate efficient distribution of the quiz packets, you will be seated according to a seating chart that is established in the Week 1 session.</li>
                <li>When you arrive at the Tuesday Quiz Session, you will leave bags/backpacks at the front of the room and take your seat according to the seating chart. Phones, calculators, notes, smart watches, electronic devices, or any study aids are not permitted during the quiz session. At your seat, you should need only pencil(s)/pen(s) and your student id. Your phone should be left in your bag.</li>
                <li>When you are done with your quiz packet, you will turn the quiz packet in to one of the proctors and show your id.</li>
                <li>If you complete your quiz packet with 15 minutes or more remaining in the session, you may request a copy of an LT quiz that was not part of your packet.</li>
                <li>Any quizzes or quiz packets distributed during the session must be turned in regardless of the status of completion.</li>
                <li>When you have turned in your quiz packet you may retrieve your things and leave the session. If you wish to remain in the session, you will need to sit quietly and retrieve your things at the end of the session.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4 id="makeup-sessions" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Make-up Quiz Sessions</h4>
        <p>We understand that sometimes you may need to miss a Tuesday quiz session due to illness or other unavoidable circumstances. LTs that you miss on one particular Tuesday will still be available at a later time. In addition, we offer <strong>two designated make-up quiz sessions during the semester.</strong> This provides a fair opportunity to make-up missed LT quizzes for students who miss up to 2-3 Tuesday quiz sessions during the semester. We cannot accommodate students who routinely and repeatedly miss Tuesday quiz sessions.</p>

                <li>You may not need the make-up session by the time it becomes available. For example, if you miss the Week 2 quiz session, when LT1F, LT2F, and LT3F are available and you succeed on these LTs before the make-up, you will not need the make-up session for Week 2.</li>
                <li>These make-ups accommodate students who miss 2-3 Tuesday sessions during the semester. We cannot accommodate students who routinely or repeatedly miss Tuesday quiz sessions.</li>

            <strong>Academic Integrity Violation:</strong> Using generative AI to complete graded work constitutes academic dishonesty and will be treated as such. This includes both direct copying and substantial paraphrasing of AI-generated content.

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Why this policy?</strong> Learning calculus requires developing your own problem-solving skills and mathematical intuition. Using AI to complete assignments prevents you from developing these essential skills and undermines the learning objectives of the course.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>If you're unsure:</strong> Please ask your instructor before using AI tools for any course-related work. We're happy to clarify what is and isn't appropriate.</p>

        <h3>Attendance Policy</h3>

        <p><strong>In-Person Classes (MWF):</strong> While attendance is strongly encouraged and contributes to your success, it is not directly graded. However, active participation and engagement during class will help you become proficient in the material.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Tuesday Learning Target Quiz Sessions:</strong> Attendance is <strong>REQUIRED</strong>. These sessions are the primary way you demonstrate proficiency on Learning Targets, which directly determines your grade. Missing more than 2-3 sessions will likely be detrimental to your grade.</p>

        <h4>Late Work Policy</h4>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Online Homeworks and PLAs:</strong> At the start of the semester you have 15 Late Passes. Using a late pass grants an automatic 1 week extension on the PLA or the Online Homework. After this one week extension (if used) these assignments remain available for ungraded practice but will not count toward XP. Late passes are used only for these online assignments and are automatically tracked by our online homework platform (MyOpenMath).</p>

        <h3>Disability Accommodation</h3>

        <p>Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. The Office for Disability Services (ODS) Web site provides contact information for every Penn State campus.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">For further information, please visit the Office for Disability Services Web site: <a href="http://equity.psu.edu/ods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://equity.psu.edu/ods</a></p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation: <a href="http://equity.psu.edu/ods/doc-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://equity.psu.edu/ods/doc-guidelines</a></p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus's disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.</p>
